## ‚ú® How It Works

### For Developers:

1. **Connect GitHub or register via email**

2. **Add your tipping button**

3. **Receive tips**
   When someone appreciates your work, they can send you tips in cryptocurrency directly through your README button.

   Support open source contributors directly with crypto.
